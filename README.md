# esx_fireDispatch-Discontiniued


Sadly, ESX_FireDispatch is no longer a thing. My job in the military includes a lot of deployments lately. Combined with the fact that I do not play FiveM anymore, I am no longer able nor willing to continiue this project. If someone wants to take over, I'd be happy to help him out, otherwise, you can see my other projects on my profile. Lots of love.



Fire script for RP servers in FiveM

This script intorduces a fully-functional Fire Departement System with Fire Callouts

**FEATURES:**  
    - *Fire Calls*  
    - *Dynamic Fires*  
    - *Fire Spreading* (still working on that)  
    - *Fire Particles Management System*  
    - *Fire Alarm System*  
    - *Fire Notification System*  
    - *Server-sided calculations (all clients see the same thing)*  
    - *Possibility to have infinite fire extinguishers*  
    - *Easy to use config*  
    - *FiRe ClOcK*  

Check the Wiki for all infos on how to setup this script for your server, help us out in the development, or just more data I don't really know how to fit here ;)

**STRUCTURE:**

In _ThingsForThePeople you will find files containing data on how things work and will be changing. This is mainly aimed to devs as the 'how to install' section should be enough for regular server owner to use. The flowcharts for example are a pseudocode version of the script for people with low lua knowledge or devs who may not understand my way of commenting

In _ThingsForTheMachine you will find all the files you'll have to put in your server folder, follow install instructions for use

**HOW TO INSTALL:**

1 - Head to the [releases](https://github.com/Pyth3rEx/esx_fireDispatch/releases) tab to download the version of your choice (don't be stupid, take the last one... unless it's broken... then don't take it...)  
2 - Create a folder called `esx_fireDispatch` in your `[ESX]` folder  
3 - Put the content of `_ThingsForTheMachine` into your `esx_fireDispatch` folder on your FiveM server  
4 - Go to your server's server.cfg and add `start esx_fireDispatch` *(try and put it pretty high up as this script requires to be started quite early, I recomend right below the 'required' ESX ressources and above any player-related plugins)*

**REQUEST TO PEOPLE UPDATING MY SCRIPT:**

PLEASE COMMENT YOUR SHIT!!! Myself (and others) are tired of finding script that have issues but due to lack of commenting it's impossible to understand, please comment your work.

_*P.S Attribute all work to their original author... don't be that dude*_

**SEE IT AT WORK:**

I usualy stream my work on the script as well as other games, in french and in english. Make sure to drop me a follow on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/pyth3rex/) to check it out!!  

**SUPPORT ME:**

I have recently started taking care of my script again, and I belive I am in a position where I can allow myself to ask for support. Feel free to support my gaming network (ZeFrench) via Tipeee. You can even watch videos for small tips that won't cost you a cent! https://en.tipeee.com/zefrench
