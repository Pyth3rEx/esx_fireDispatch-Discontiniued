    - *Fire Particles Management System*  
    - *Fire Alarm System*  
    - *Server-sided calculations (all clients see the same thing)*  

Check the Wiki for all infos on how to setup this script for your server, help us out in the development, or just more data I don't really know how to fit here ;)

**STRUCTURE:**

in _ThingsForThePeople you will find files containing data on how thigns work and will be changing. This is mainly aimed to devs as the 'how to install' section should be enought for regular server owner to use. The flowcharts for example are a pseudocode version of the script for people with low lua knowledge or devs who may not understand my way of commenting

in _ThingsForTheMachine you will find all the files you'll have to put in your server folder, follow install instructions for us

**HOW TO INSTALL:**

1 - Head to the [releases](https://github.com/Pyth3rEx/esx_fireDispatch/releases) tab to download the version of your choice (don't be stupid, take the last one... unless it's broken... then don't take it...)  
2 - Put the content of `_ThingsForTheMachine` into your [ESX] folder on your FiveM server
3 - Go to your server's server.cfg and add `start esx_fireDispatch` *(try and put it pretty high up as this script requires to be started quite early, I recomend right below the 'required' ESX ressources and above any player-related plugins)*

**REQUEST TO PEOPLE UPDATING MY SCRIPT:**

PLEASE COMMENT YOUR SHIT!!! Myself (and others) are tired of finding script that have trouble but due to lack of commenting it's impossible to understand, please comment your work.

_*P.S Attribute all work to their original author... don't be that dude*_
