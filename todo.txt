- Make the fire server side
- Fire spreading
- Attach the fire to the vehicle  <= Kinda done (overided by "bug")
- Add a choice in vehicles to spawn / pick random vehicle from list
- Do not spawn fires while it rains.... caus it's stupid looking...
- Add custom alarm sound

DONE:
- Fix PlaySoundFromCoords
- Added Rythm to the alarm



















Spreading:
------------------------------------------------- DIDN'T WORK!!!!
Map size:
Y = -4000 <> 8000
X = -3900 <> 6000

for i = 1, 8000, -4000
    for i = 1, 6000, -3900
     Get closest fire
     Get a random value
     Randomly decide if the fire should spread, which direction, and which fire particles to use
    end
end
------------------------------------------------- DIDN'T WORK!!!!


In the background:
remove all fires and respawn them?
spawn new fires on top of existing ones? (could be cool to get random calls when player destroy their cars lol)

need a way to find all fire entities on the map and use a for loop to spread them or not. (if extinguished quick enough they won't spread)


for i = 1, #scriptData.firePositionsX, 1 do
    closestFireDist = vDist(getClosestFire and coords stored in scriptData.firePositions[XYZ])

    if closestFireDist <= 2 then
        RANDOMLY CHECK FOR FIRE Spreading
    else
        Remove closest particles
    end
end








Extinguishing fire: ???
Check for small fires (entities)
If small fires are deleted (extinguished)
    remove particles
end
